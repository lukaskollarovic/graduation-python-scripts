## Requirements

These Python scripts require a Python interpreter to run. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

To use any of the scripts in this collection, follow these general steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where the script is located using the `cd` command.

3. Run the script using the `python` command followed by the script's filename, like so:

   ```
   python script_name.py
   ```

4. Follow the script's prompts or read its comments and documentation to understand how to use it effectively.

## Scripts Descriptions

Below, you'll find brief descriptions of some of the key scripts in this collection. Each script may have its own detailed documentation within its source code.

- **ATM.py:** Simulates an ATM machine for basic banking operations.
- **BMI.py:** Calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input.
- **GCD.py:** Computes the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
- **caesar.py:** Implements the Caesar cipher for text encryption and decryption.
- **bubblesort_ascending.py:** Sorts a list of numbers in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.
- **text_stats.py:** Analyzes text to provide statistics like word count, character count, and more.
